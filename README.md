Creating a New Animal for the Zoo: Creating a Factor from Text Data

Goals
• Manipulate and visualize financial Tweets
• Clean text data
• Train a model to predict Tweets’ sentiment
• Compute a measure of media attention

Big picture context
• You’ve just been hired by a sophisticated hedge-fund
• The hedge-fund manager is interested in Twitter’s predictive power
• He asks you to perform sentiment analysis on a sample of recent financial tweets...
• ... and to build a firm-level measure of media attention: that may be a great factor idea !
